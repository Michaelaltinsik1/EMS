# Employee management system

This project is a full stack application created in React, Express.js, Node.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, MySQL, Prisma and Figma.

I started by doing research on what a simple employee management system could look like and what basic functionality would be needed. Once I had a picture of how the system would work, I started creating the different views and components for the application on figma.

When I finished the figma design, I started thinking about how the backend itself would work. First, I created a database schema with the different entities and their relationships to each other. Then I decided what technologies I would use. In addition to the aforementioned technologies, I also used a bunch of npm packages.

Some npm packages that I used on the frontend side were React Hook Form and Yup for form validation and React Toastify for notification. On the backend I also used various npm packages like bcrypt, express-validator and jsonwebtoken to handle authentication, authorization and validation on the server.
